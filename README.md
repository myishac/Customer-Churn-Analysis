# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Business Problem:

Customers from a Telecommunication company are no longer using the company’s services. This proves to be a business problem since the company is losing revenue for every customer that leaves. Aside from lost business, customer churn has a negative impact as it gives the company a bad reputation. This could deter future customers from wanting to use the company’s services/buy the products as they know that their past customers were not satisfied and chose to discontinue the use of services/purchase products. Customers leaving could also be the result of an underlying problem, such as having a bad product or being overpriced. The reason it’s worth looking into this business problem is that there are multiple factors at play that could be hurting a company with a high churn rate.

Analytic Problem:

The analytical problem in the case of analyzing churn rate would be determining which factors are common between customers that are choosing to discontinue the use of products or services offered by the company. The factors in this analysis can be used to predict whether a customer is likely to leave, which will allow the company the opportunity to take mitigating action.

Goal:

The main goal here is to deal with the issue of churn rate as it can have a negative impact on the company in several regards. Machine learning algorithms will be used to predict if certain customers will churn and the ways in which it can be prevented.
