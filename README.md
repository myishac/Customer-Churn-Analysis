# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Business Problem:

Customers from a Telecommunication company are no longer using the companyâ€™s services. There are multiple factors at play that could be hurting a company with a high churn rate, identifying those factors can help prevent churn and retain customers.

## Analytic Problem:

The analytical problem would be determining which factors are common between customers that are choosing to discontinue the use of products or services offered by the company. The factors in this analysis can be used to predict whether a customer is likely to leave, which will allow the company the opportunity to take mitigating action.

## Goal:

The goal here is to deal with the issue of churn rate as it can have a negative impact on the company in several regards. Machine learning algorithms will be used to predict if certain customers will churn and the ways in which it can be prevented.
